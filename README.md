# 🔔 Arduino-Based LPG Gas Leakage Detection System

An Arduino UNO-based project to detect LPG gas leakage using an MQ-6 sensor, buzzer, and LCD display.  
The system alerts users with *visual (LCD)* and *audible (buzzer)* warnings, ensuring safety in homes and workplaces.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Connect the MQ-6 sensor, buzzer, and LCD to Arduino UNO as per the circuit.  
2. Open lpg_code.ino in Arduino IDE.  
3. Upload the code to Arduino UNO.  
4. Observe readings on Serial Monitor and LCD.  
5. If LPG gas is detected, buzzer will sound and LCD shows warning.

## 📌 Future Scope
- Add *IoT integration* (send SMS/alerts via GSM or Wi-Fi).  
- Add *mobile app monitoring*.  
- Include *battery backup* for power failures.
